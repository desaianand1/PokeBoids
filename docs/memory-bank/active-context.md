# Active Context: Pok√©Boids Simulation

## Current Work Focus

### 1. Critical Priority: Activate Biological Systems üî•

Following the successful completion of the Strategy Pattern Implementation (Task #1), the project has reached a unique state where all biological features are **implemented in code but not active in gameplay**. This represents the highest priority work:

- [ ] **Implement predator-prey interactions**: Connect existing attack/damage systems to actual gameplay
- [ ] **Trigger combat animations**: Link attack/hurt animation states to predator-prey encounters
- [ ] **Add death mechanics**: Remove boids when health reaches zero (system exists but not connected)
- [ ] **Visual health feedback**: Display health/stamina status in UI or on boids themselves
- [ ] **Activate reproduction**: Create new boids when reproduction thresholds are met

### 2. Performance Optimization for Large Populations

- [ ] **Scale to 200+ boids**: Current performance drops with very large populations
- [ ] **Memory management**: Optimize for long-running simulations
- [ ] **GPU utilization**: Better leverage hardware acceleration
- [ ] **WebGL optimization**: Improve rendering performance

### 3. Enhanced Educational Value

- [ ] **Biological parameter controls**: Connect existing UI controls to active biological systems
- [ ] **Ecosystem balance**: Implement self-regulating predator-prey dynamics
- [ ] **Visual feedback systems**: Health bars, stamina indicators, reproduction status

### 3. Biological Systems - Code Complete but Inactive ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical Gap**: All biological features exist in code but are not connected to gameplay:

- **Stats System**: Health, stamina, speed, reproduction, level, sex, attack (implemented)
- **Damage System**: `takeDamage()` method exists but never called in gameplay
- **Stamina System**: Speed-based depletion and recovery (active)
- **Reproduction System**: Progress tracking exists but no actual reproduction
- **Animation States**: Attack/hurt animations exist but not triggered by combat

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions (This Week)

- [ ] **Connect predator-prey interactions**: Implement collision detection between predators and prey
- [ ] **Trigger combat animations**: Call `playAttack()` and `playHurt()` during encounters
- [ ] **Implement death mechanics**: Remove boids when `takeDamage()` returns true
- [ ] **Add visual health indicators**: Show health/stamina status in statistics panel or on boids

### 2. Short-term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

- [ ] **Activate reproduction system**: Create new boids when reproduction thresholds met
- [ ] **Enhanced predator behaviors**: Implement hunting mechanics with existing attack radius
- [ ] **Prey evasion**: Enhanced escape behaviors when predators detected
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Scale to 200+ boids while maintaining 60 FPS

## Critical Path Forward

The project is at a pivotal moment where all foundational systems are complete and professional-quality, but the core educational value proposition (predator-prey dynamics) requires activation of existing biological systems. This represents a unique opportunity to deliver significant educational impact with relatively focused development effort.

**Success Definition**: Activate biological systems to create a fully functional ecosystem simulation where predators hunt prey, boids reproduce, and populations self-regulate - all using the robust foundation already in place.
