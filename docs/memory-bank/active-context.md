# Active Context: Boids Simulation

## Current Work Focus

### 1. Simulation Core Development

- [x] Completed separation of boid and flocking behavior from Phaser rendering
- [x] Implemented adapter pattern for framework-agnostic core logic
- [x] Centralized event system implementation
- [x] Addressed configuration management TODOs
- [x] Refactored update method redundancy
- [] Improving performance metrics with focus on 60 FPS target

### 2. UI Improvements

- Refactoring control panel components to use Svelte 5 runes
- Adding simulation parameters for biological features
- Implementing responsive design with shadcn-svelte components
- Enhancing theme switching with day/night backgrounds

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- Expanding unit test coverage for boid behaviors
- Adding integration tests for predator-prey interactions
- Implementing performance benchmarks for FPS and memory usage
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline with Vitest

## Recent Changes

### 1. Codebase Updates

- Fully migrated to Svelte 5 runes syntax (no stores)
- Implemented strict TypeScript types throughout
- Updated Phaser to latest version with modern syntax
- Integrated shadcn-svelte components with TailwindCSS
- Completed core behavior separation with adapter pattern

### 2. Architecture Changes

- Implemented component-scoped state with runes
- Centralized event system with unified event bus
- Optimized rendering with GPU acceleration
- Enhanced component structure using atomic design
- Separated core boid logic from rendering concerns
- Simplified event handling with type-safe adapters
- Added event debugging and monitoring capabilities

### 3. Dependency Updates

- Updated all dependencies to latest versions
- Removed deprecated packages
- Added new development tools
- Improved build process

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Priorities

- [x] Centralized event bus implementation
- [x] Simplified event system architecture
- [x] Refactored PhaserBoid update method
- [x] Added event debugging capabilities
- [x] Add spatial partioning to flocking logic to improve performance significantly
  - Implemented quad tree spatial partitioning
  - Added event-based world bounds handling
  - Created comprehensive tests and benchmarks
- [ ] Document separation architecture and patterns
