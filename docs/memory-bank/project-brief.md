# Pok√©Boids: Interactive Ecosystem Simulation

## Project Overview

Pok√©Boids is an educational artificial life simulation implementing Craig Reynolds' classic boids algorithm with enhanced biological characteristics and predator-prey dynamics. Built with SvelteKit and Phaser 3, it visualizes emergent flocking behaviors using animated Pok√©mon sprites, serving as both an interactive learning tool for AI/ML concepts and a platform for behavioral experimentation.

### Core Purpose & Educational Value

- **Emergent Behavior Demonstration**: Visualizes how simple rules create complex flocking patterns
- **Predator-Prey Dynamics**: Models biological ecosystem interactions (foundation implemented, activation needed)
- **Interactive Learning Platform**: Real-time parameter exploration for AI/ML and complex systems concepts
- **Visual Algorithm Understanding**: Makes abstract computational concepts tangible through animation
- **Research Foundation**: Clean, well-documented codebase suitable for academic reference and extension

## Boids Algorithm Foundation

### The Three Classic Rules

Each boid implements Craig Reynolds' three fundamental flocking behaviors:

#### 1. Alignment ‚úÖ Implemented

- Boids gradually steer toward the average direction of neighboring boids
- User-adjustable alignment factor with real-time slider control
- Smooth velocity matching for natural movement transitions

#### 2. Cohesion ‚úÖ Implemented

- Boids gradually steer toward the average position of neighboring boids
- User-adjustable coherence factor with immediate visual feedback
- Smooth interpolation for natural movement patterns

#### 3. Separation ‚úÖ Implemented

- Boids avoid collisions by steering away from neighbors
- User-adjustable separation factor with real-time parameter control
- Distance-based weighting (closer boids have stronger effect)

### Advanced Behavioral Features

#### Field of View System ‚úÖ Implemented

- **Cone-based Perception**: Configurable vision angles and ranges
- **Type-Specific Vision**:
  - Predators: Narrow FoV (70% of base) with extended range (130%)
  - Prey: Wide FoV (130% of base) with reduced range (80%)
- **Debug Visualization**: Optional FoV cone rendering for development and education
- **Real-time Adjustment**: UI controls for base FoV angle with immediate effect

#### Group-Based Flocking ‚úÖ Implemented

- **Auto-Generated Groups**: Boids assigned unique group IDs for species-specific behavior
- **Selective Interaction**: Boids only flock with same-group members for realistic behavior
- **Visual Distinction**: Different sprites for predator/prey within each environment flavor
- **Performance Benefits**: Reduced computation through group-based neighbor filtering
