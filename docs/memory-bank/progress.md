## Biological Features - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### Currently Implemented ‚úÖ

- [x] **Basic stats system**: Health, stamina, speed, reproduction, level, sex, attack (predators)
- [x] **Stamina system**: Speed-based depletion with recovery mechanics
- [x] **Damage system**: Health reduction with event emission
- [x] **Leveling system**: Basic stat increases on level up
- [x] **Reproduction tracking**: Progress toward reproduction with limits

### Missing Implementation ‚ùå

- [ ] **Predator-prey interactions**: No actual hunting or attack mechanics
- [ ] **Health/damage visualization**: No visual feedback for damage taken
- [ ] **Reproduction mechanics**: Stats tracked but no actual reproduction occurs
- [ ] **Death and removal**: Boids don't die when health reaches zero
- [ ] **Attack animations**: Animation states exist but not triggered by combat
- [ ] **Biological parameter controls**: UI exists but biological features not active

## Known Issues

### 1. Performance

- Frame rate drops with very large boid populations (>200 boids)
- Memory usage optimization needed for long-running simulations
- GPU utilization could be improved for better performance

### 2. Biological Systems

- **Critical Gap**: Biological features are implemented in code but not active in gameplay
- Stats system exists but predator-prey interactions don't occur
- Animation states (attack, hurt) exist but aren't triggered
- No visual feedback for health, stamina, or reproduction status

### 3. UI/UX

- Some parameter controls could be more responsive
- Mobile layout needs minor optimizations

- Event-driven architecture provides loose coupling and extensibility
- Adapter pattern cleanly separates concerns
- Spatial partitioning enables excellent performance scaling

### Key Technical Decisions

- Svelte 5 runes for modern reactive programming
- Phaser 3 for proven game engine capabilities
